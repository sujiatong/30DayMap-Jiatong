## D1 - Points
This map visualizes primary and commercial airports across California. I use the airport symbol instead of the point, which improves readability and make it more engaging and intuitive for viewers to identify airport locations.

## D12 - Time and Space
This map highlights how cartography and data visualization can bring history to life, offering insights into one of the most transformative eras in Chinese history. In this map, I use stack territorial polygon of each time period, and showing different color to distinguish changing of Territorial.

- 1820 (25th year of Jiaqing - 嘉慶二十五年): The Qing Dynasty’s territory was at its peak, but the nation’s strength began to decline (嘉道中衰).

- 1911 (3rd year of Xuantong - 宣統三年): By this time—the final year of the dynasty—foreign powers had seized large portions of land, and the empire’s borders were significantly reduced.
